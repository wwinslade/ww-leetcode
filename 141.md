# 141: Linked List Cycle
Easy. Beats 84.22% on runtime, 63.91% on memory.


My solution used Floyd's Cycle Finding Algorithm, which works by keeping two pointers, one which traverses the list "faster" than the other. If the faster pointer ever catches the slower pointer, we know the graph has a cycle in it.

This is an O(n) solution, which for something like this is about as fast as we're going to get.

```
class Solution {
public:
    bool hasCycle(ListNode *head) {
        ListNode *sp;
        ListNode *fp;

        sp = head;
        fp = head;

        while (sp != NULL && fp != NULL && fp->next != NULL) {
            sp = sp->next;
            fp = fp->next->next;

            if (sp == fp) return true;
        }

        return false;

    }
};
```
